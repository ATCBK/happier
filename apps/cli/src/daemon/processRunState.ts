 * - `stopped`: SIGSTOPped/traced — alive, holds its lock, serves nothing.
 * - `zombie`: defunct — signalable on some platforms, permanently dead.
 *
 * Incident class: daemon log 2026-06-12 "Resume requested ... but session is already running"
 * while the runner cannot serve; the user message is materialized into the pending queue and
 * never consumed.
