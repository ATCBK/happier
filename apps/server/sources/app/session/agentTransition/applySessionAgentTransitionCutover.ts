/**
 * Same-Session cross-Agent transition — the ordered cutover.
 *
 * Two existing owner boundaries are crossed IN ORDER and deliberately not forced
 * into one database transaction:
 *
 *   1. `commitSessionAgentCurrentView` — one narrow transaction writing the sealed
 *      target current view and clearing the current runtime projections.
 *   2. the canonical `createSessionMessage` owner — an ordered idempotent divider
 *      append in its own normal transaction.
 *
 * The split is NOT because atomicity would need a new extraction:
 * `writeSessionTranscriptMessageInTx` already exists and already has two
 * in-transaction callers. The split exists because a raw in-transaction
 * transcript write would bypass the behaviors `createSessionMessage` layers on
 * top of it, and this write genuinely exercises each one: session edit access,
 * stored-content admission for the Account's encryption mode, hosted write
 * authority, message-role resolution, the activity/ready projection, participant
 * change cursors, the read-cursor advance and badge accounting that keep the
 * divider from minting a phantom unread, and the publication inputs the route
 * emits. Anyone revisiting this split must argue those bypassed behaviors.
 *
 * Publisher fencing is deliberately NOT in that list. It is reached only on the
 * trusted-provenance path, and this write cannot use it: the fence compares
 * against a CURRENT session publisher, and the source publisher is gone by the
 * time the cutover runs. Owner-only reachability is what protects the reserved
 * localId instead — every generic client ingress refuses the prefix.
 *
 * It accepts one narrow crash state — target current view committed, divider
 * absent — which the caller reports as `partially_applied` with
 * `divider_unavailable`. No transition marker, receipt, phase, or second transaction
 * is added to reconstruct the missing presentation event.
