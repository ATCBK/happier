 * bearer travels from the create transaction straight to that boundary and is
 * never returned to the manager, logged, or retained.
 *
 * Delivery runs after the invitation has committed and outside any transaction,
 * so a slow or failing SMTP conversation can never hold a database transaction
 * open or roll a real invitation back.
