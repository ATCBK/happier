 * its metadata is a column on `Team`, not a row owned by whoever uploaded it.
 * That is the whole reason this is not `uploadImage` — an Account-owned
 * `UploadedFile` row is deleted with its uploader during Account erasure, which
 * would silently strip a company's branding when an employee leaves.
 *
 * There is no blob-cleanup queue. A replacement deletes exactly the reference it
 * displaced, read inside the committing transaction, and a failed commit deletes
 * only the candidate it just uploaded.
