/**
 * The external-fact transaction seam.

 * These four adapters are the *only* way an enterprise directory changes native
 * Team authorization. They delegate to the same membership and Group-contribution
 * owners the native UI uses, which is what makes "one membership writer" a
 * property of the code rather than a convention each reconciler must remember.
 *
 * Every adapter takes the caller's existing transaction. The caller prepares
 * complete evidence outside it and applies the whole set inside one transaction,
 * so an initial import or a source revocation is never observable as partially
 * committed native access. No adapter starts its own transaction, calls an
 * external API, or returns a cursor for "the rest of the access changes".
 *
 * External state is provenance, never authorization: nothing here reads a
 * provider claim, an eligibility status, or a directory projection to decide
 * whether access is permitted. It decides only which canonical row a confirmed
 * external observation maps to.
