/**
 * Admit one Account to a Team, minting its membership lifetime and history horizon.

 * This is the single admission entry. Team creation, direct add, invitation
 * acceptance, and the external-fact adapters all call it, which is what makes
 * "one membership produced exactly once per native, email, and directory path" a
 * property of the code rather than a convention each caller must remember.
 *
 * The actor or internal source is validated by the calling mutation service, which
 * also owns the capability decision; this function deliberately does not re-decide
 * authorization, so there is exactly one place that answers "may you do this".
 *
 * Admission is idempotent by design. An Account that is already a member is
 * reported as `already_member` with its current lifetime, and its role, status, and
 * horizon are left exactly as they are: a retried invitation acceptance or a
 * directory replay must never silently widen someone's history or restore a role an
 * administrator has since changed. Only the explicit role, status, and management
 * mutations change those facts.
