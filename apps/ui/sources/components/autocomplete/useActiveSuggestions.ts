/**
 * Resolves the suggestion list for the active composer token and owns which
 * candidate is selected.
 *
 * Two contracts live here:
 *
 * - **Selection tracks candidate identity, never a numeric index (INV-6/D-11).**
 *   The picker is sectioned, so a single keystroke can change how many rows the
 *   Files section contributes and push the Plugins section down. An index-based
 *   selection silently lands on a different row when that happens. The tracked
 *   identity is the candidate the *user* moved onto (`pinnedKey`) and it survives
 *   the keystroke that changes the query — that is the case D-11 names. An
 *   `autoSelectFirst` highlight is not a choice and is never pinned, so typing one
 *   more character still re-selects the best match.
 * - **One `AbortController` per query (D-15).** `ValueSync` runs its command
 *   serially: without an abort, a superseded query would keep the queue for the
 *   full duration of its slowest kind before the next keystroke even started.
