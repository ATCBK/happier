/**
 * The server's own account of which local-service preview prerequisite is unmet.
 *
 * `apps/server/sources/app/features/localServicesFeature.ts:52-110` computes one code per failed
 * prerequisite. Without a reader the client can only say "previews are disabled", and an operator
 * cannot tell which of eleven environment variables is wrong.
 *
 * One surface-level observation supplies both the canonical feature decision and its reasons.
 * Retained hidden Services panes keep their state, but do not own feature loads or retries. The
 * existing exact-Home cache supplies last-known facts immediately on reopen while the presented
 * observation revalidates them. Read that cache at render time: an observer can still hold its
 * previous Home's snapshot before the Home-change effect runs.
 *
 * Reasons are empty while server features are loading or unreachable, so callers keep whatever
 * generic copy they already show rather than naming a prerequisite the server has not reported.
