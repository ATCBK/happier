 * Archived rows are not part of the ordinary list, so nothing else brings them to the client. This is the
 * Sessions list's own exact-Home subtree query, asked for the archived corpus under this lead (the Bots
 * roster asks the same query for the active one). It hydrates the shared rows without publishing a
 * membership of its own; the Work projection reads those rows from the store like every other report. A
 * Home that cannot answer a filtered listing simply shows none, as before.
