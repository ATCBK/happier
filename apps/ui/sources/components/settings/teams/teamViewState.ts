 * a Team has answered, its projection keeps rendering through every refresh,
 * wake and failure. A surface that blanked on a dropped connection would make a
 * Team owner believe their Team or their authority had disappeared.
 *
 * `mutationsAvailable` closes writes on the same signal that keeps reads open: a
 * stale projection is fine to read and wrong to decide against, because the Home
 * has already moved past the capabilities being rendered.
