 * The one way a Team surface invokes a Team intent.

 * Every Team, member, Group and invitation wrapper goes through the canonical
 * `ActionExecutor.execute` front door, so Action settings, per-surface
 * enablement, dangerous-action approval and provenance are enforced for Team
 * governance exactly as they are for every other Action. The Home HTTP executor
 * stays *below* the front door as a transport dependency; calling it directly
 * from a wrapper would bypass all of that, which is why the Home identity and
 * Team identity clients that still do so are not a precedent to copy.
 *
 * This module owns no paths, no codecs and no policy. The Action row declares
 * the method, path and schemas; the front door owns admission and approval; the
 * family dependency owns which Home the intent is carried to.
 */

/**
 * One front door per exact Home and Account.
 *
 * The executor's default Home port targets the *focused* Home, which is right
 * for an Agent or voice invocation that names none and wrong for every Team
 * screen: a Team screen was opened for one exact Home and must complete against
 * it even if the person focuses another mid-flight. So each scope gets a
 * scope-bound port passed through the executor's own `homeDomainAction` opt —
 * the sanctioned way to address another Home — while admission, Action
 * settings, approval and output validation stay with the shared front door.
 *
 * Executors are cached per scope because building one is not free and a device
 * holds few Homes; the cache holds no Team state and no credentials.

 * another intent, another Account or another Home is ignored rather than
 * mistaken for this one's answer. Reads instead retain their original invocation
