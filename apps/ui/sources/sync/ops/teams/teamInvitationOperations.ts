/**
 * Team invitation reads and mutations, addressed to one explicit Home.
 *
 * The raw bearer exists in exactly two answers — creation and reissue — and is
 * never stored, re-read, logged, or carried anywhere else: the listed row has no
 * bearer field at all, so a manager reviewing outstanding invitations cannot
 * recover a secret and a lost link can only be replaced by reissuing.
 *
 * That is why those two alone take a mount-scoped `signal` instead of the
 * deferred result handlers every other Team mutation here uses. They are
 * declared live-only custody: an explicit UI approval keeps the invocation
 * pending through the shared blocking waiter and returns the raw answer to that
 * live call, while the durable approval Artifact retains only the safe
 * observation projection. A deferred continuation would require the bearer to
 * be re-readable afterwards, which is exactly the property this domain refuses.
 *
 * Preview and accept are the pre-authentication transport of the same owner and
 * carry the bearer in a strict versioned body, never in a query string.
