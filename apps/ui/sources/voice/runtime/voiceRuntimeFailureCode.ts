/**
 * How a Voice runtime outcome ended badly.
 *
 * `declined`/`failed` are named by the provider runtime's machine ports.
 * `unsettled` covers a Start the controller refused or abandoned without
 * reaching a port. `unstarted` covers a Start the lifecycle owner refused
 * before any provider runtime was involved at all — the only outcomes that
 * otherwise leave no trace anywhere.
 *
 * `unregistered` covers a provider runtime excluded while its bundled leaf was
 * composed, so it never reaches the adapter registry and no Start of it can
 * report anything. It is recorded once per excluded leaf per composition.
 *
 * `transcript_dropped` covers an authoritative transcript event the runtime
 * refused to project. A conversation keeps running after such a refusal — for a
 * WebRTC provider the user still hears and is heard — so the loss is otherwise
 * indistinguishable from a provider that never spoke. It is recorded once per
 * guard per attempt, never once per event.
 *
 * `unapplied` covers an explicit Voice settings gesture — the user chose a
 * concrete outcome — that reached no write. Such a gesture is otherwise
 * indistinguishable from one that was never delivered at all: the surface
 * closes, nothing changes, and nothing is reported. It is recorded once per
 * gesture.
 *
 * `provider_error` records a sanitized, nonterminal provider diagnostic. It
 * does not mark the conversation failed or authorize reconnect or retries.
