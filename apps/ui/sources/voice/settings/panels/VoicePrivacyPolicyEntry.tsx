/**
 * §2.8 / §7.3 — the compliance entry point for Voice.
 *
 * No active Voice surface carries a provider/data-disclosure affordance, so Voice
 * settings is the only in-app destination for the privacy story. The provider's
 * own processing disclosure already renders above, from its declaration; this row
 * is the *public policy*, and it sits at the bottom of the screen on purpose — it
 * is a place to go when you want it, not something to interrupt someone with.
 *
 * `SettingRow` shares its label and searchable anchor with the Action declaration.
 * Its `onPress` stays focusable, keyboard activatable and announced with a role.
 * `openExternalUrl` is the canonical opener
 * — hand-rolling `Linking` here would fork web (which needs `window.open` with
 * `noopener`) away from native.
