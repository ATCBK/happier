 * detail's title) pads its content by that measure and provides it here; the self-insetting anatomy inside
 * subtracts it, so a sheet still sits on the sheet edge and a heading on the text edge instead of twice inset.
 * Absent (every page), nothing is drawn yet: `0`. A host that mounts public sections inside a page whose own
 * sections already sit on that edge (Happier's core page column) provides the edge here.
