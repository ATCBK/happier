# Slack Channels

Unreleased 0.3 development provider for Channels c0.73 F1. Slack Socket Mode
uses an outbound WebSocket, so the selected Machine needs no public HTTP
listener. Enable Channels and Slack Channels, connect the app credentials,
then create a connection and bind a conversation to a Session or thread router.
This source implementation is not a stable-release availability claim.

## Prepare a Slack app

Create an app in the workspace that will own the connection. This manifest uses
message events for joined channels, private channels, direct messages and group
direct messages. It deliberately does not also subscribe to `app_mention`:
mentions are recognizable in the message text, and subscribing to both streams
can produce two events for one message. App manifest and subscription contracts:
[Slack Socket Mode](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode/),
[message events](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message/), and

```

Install the app to that workspace and invite the bot to the conversations it
should observe. Generate an app-level token with `connections:write`. The
Slack bot Connected Account holds both the non-rotating bot token (`xoxb-`) and
app-level token (`xapp-`) as secrets; Channel setup receives only the account
reference. Rotating-token refresh and organization-wide multi-workspace
installation are outside this first vertical. See

## Implementation contract

The provider consumes the existing Channels contribution, Connected Accounts,
background services and HTTP/WebSocket services. Channels remains the owner of
pairing, bindings, Session admission, deduplication, text splitting and delivery
custody. No Slack checkpoint, binding store or HTTP listener is introduced.

Socket Mode obtains a rotating URL with `apps.connections.open`; the app token
must correspond to the bot's app. `auth.test` supplies the workspace/bot IDs,
`bots.info` supplies its `app_id`, and the socket's authenticated
`hello.connection_info.app_id` supplies the comparison during setup, connection
tests and observer startup. Account health verifies that both tokens are
accepted; the shared socket handshake owns app correspondence. Event acknowledgements
follow successful core admission; reconnects cannot promise replay of missed
events. Native `event_id` supplies occurrence identity to the core census.

Endpoint IDs are scoped to the authenticated workspace. `is_im` conversations
are direct; channels and multi-person conversations are shared. A thread uses
its root `thread_ts` below the parent channel. Principals use immutable Slack
user IDs in that workspace, never display-name equality. Exact-ID
`users.info` is an authenticated resolver; unverified or foreign-workspace
identities must use core pairing. Sources:

[conversation objects](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/objects/conversation-object/),

Select an existing conversation with its Slack channel ID (`C…`, `G…` or `D…`).
An exact thread can be selected with
`slack:<workspace-id>:channel:<channel-id>:thread:<root-ts>`.
The authenticated [`chat.getPermalink`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/chat.getPermalink/)
response verifies that the selected message exists and normalizes replies to
their root timestamp (retrieved 2026-10-20). Principals accept an exact `U…` or
`W…` user ID, or the provider's workspace-qualified principal ID. Shared-space
pairing uses Channels' existing exact-endpoint proof and owner review.

The output representation is plain text with Slack automatic parsing
disabled and explicit mention delimiters neutralized. Core splits using the
declared 40,000-character native ceiling, rather than treating Slack's 4,000
character recommendation as a hard limit. `chat.postMessage.thread_ts` preserves
thread replies. Both unfurl flags implement link-preview suppression. HTTP 429
`Retry-After` enters core custody; an uncertain send response must not trigger
blind resend. Sources:

Socket reconnects report continuity loss through core history-gap/readiness
Actions and preserve the existing explicit baseline-recovery journey. Socket
receive progress is not a durable checkpoint. Edits become bodyless
`unsupportedEdit`; deletes are ignored. Files and rich/shared attachments become
bodyless `unsupportedContent`, so attachment text cannot become a command.
No `attachmentFetch` role or HTTP Events API transport is declared in this unit.

## Release acceptance

The Channels orchestrator owns loaded development-stack QA (`RELOAD NEEDED`).
A real Slack workspace must verify app/bot correspondence,
message scopes, mention notification suppression, Unicode text boundaries,
thread replies, reconnect gaps, rate limits and credential repair before
release. Source tests use documented HTTP/WebSocket boundary fakes and the real
Channels composition/conformance harness. No live workspace or real Slack send
is part of those tests.
