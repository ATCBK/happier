# FX conversation fixture provenance

Sanitized source-derived v0.0.14 fixture, not an installed-CLI capture. Exact
vendor tag commit: `vercel-labs/fx@1a070af32cdfaf8cd0da6de3dc7f053302828b17`.

- `src/core/session/session_codec.zig:301–360`: schema-4 `session.json` metadata.
- `src/core/session/session_event.zig:24–193,440–500`: conversation frame
  versions 1–3, JSON union encoding, native `seq` and timestamps.
- `src/core/session/session_log.zig:2040–2110,2380–2620`: completed-turn replay,
  steering, interrupted turns and checkpoints. An unfinished tail is not a
  committed turn. Steering retains its assistant prefix.
- `src/acp/sessions.zig:1713–1805,1880–2035`: ACP discovery emits the same native
  session id; history replay visits complete archived turns. Context checkpoints
  change model context but do not erase archived user-visible history; their
  summaries are not emitted as user/assistant messages.
- `src/core/session/result_store.zig:640–660,698–750` and
  `session_child_store.zig:350–362`: result handles name files in `tool-results`.

Only prose, identifiers, timestamps and paths were replaced. No vendor writer,
migration, export, server, or Agent turn was run. The opt-in sessions-v2 backend
(`session_adapter.zig:1–27,76–84`) is a distinct dialect and needs explicit
unsupported coverage until separately characterized; it must not become an
empty successful search. Likewise schema-3 metadata/event-log storage is not
schema-4 conversation-frame storage.
