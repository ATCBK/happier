/**
 * GitLab `Link` header pagination.
 *
 * GitLab returns `Link` headers with `rel` of `prev`, `next`, `first` or `last` on
 * each response, and for keyset pagination states outright that only the given link
 * may be used to retrieve the next page. So the next page URL is followed
 * byte-for-byte: it is never rebuilt, re-signed, re-ordered, or reduced.
 *
 * `x-total`, `x-total-pages` and `rel="last"` are advisory and GitLab omits them
 * above 10,000 records, so their absence proves nothing about collection size and no
 * completeness claim may read them.
 *
 * The header grammar itself is RFC 8288 rather than a GitLab rule, and the credential
 * gate on a URL GitLab supplied is the same gate every forge needs, so both come from
 * `@happier-dev/triage-sources`. What a `next` MEANS here — keyset, verbatim, never
 * reconstructed — stays this source's decision.
