/**
 * The commit a GitLab merge request is currently at, read from one raw row.
 *
 * One reader, because there are two callers who must agree byte for byte or the
 * gate they share stops working: the scan/get mapper publishes this value as the
 * observation's `nativeRevision`, and the mutation preflight reads it back off
 * its own fresh read to compare. A second, similar-but-different rule — one
 * preferring `diff_refs`, one trimming differently — would let a merge request
 * refuse every write while looking correct in both files.
 *
 * `sha` is the merge request's own diff head, and it is what GitLab's merge
 * endpoint compares its `sha` precondition against. `diff_refs.head_sha` is read
 * only as a fallback, and only in that order, because GitLab documents
 * `diff_refs` as *initially empty* on a freshly created merge request
 * (`sources/SCM.md` §4.7.2): treating an unpopulated field as authoritative would
 * publish "no head" for a merge request that has one.
 *
 * `null` means GitLab reported no head *yet*. It never means the merge request
 * has no commits, and it is never repaired from a branch name, a pipeline's sha,
 * or a per-file diff — none of which is the source-branch head.
