/**
 * The Composer entry picker.
 *
 * It is the second consumer of the ONE mounted window, and it reaches the same
 * rows through the same store the shell list reads: opening it over a fresh
 * window issues no provider call at all, and over a cold or stale one it says
 * so and offers **Refresh** rather than showing an empty list (`REQ-14`).
 *
 * It writes to exactly one draft: the one the host stamped on this mount. That
 * address comes from the mount input rather than from "the composer that is
 * open", because two drafts can be live at once and attaching to the wrong one
 * is discovered only after sending.
 *
 * It holds no selected set. Which entries are attached is derived from the
 * canonical composer snapshot on every build, so a host badge removal, an undo
 * or a closed scope settles here without a picker cache re-creating it.
 *
 * Search is local to this picker and never reaches a provider: it filters rows
 * the shared window already holds, and it deliberately does not re-lens the
 * shared window, because narrowing the list behind the reader's back while they
 * type in a popover would be a surprising second effect.
 *
 * Every row is a labelled group with two independent controls. The row itself
 * does nothing when pressed: only Attach/Remove and View details
 * commit an effect, they never fire each other, and their pending and failure
 * state never merge — a navigation refusal must not clear a mutation failure
 * the reader has not seen yet.
