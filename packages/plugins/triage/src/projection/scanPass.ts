/**
 * One materialization pass over the configured source instances.
 *
 * The pass walks pages serially inside each lane and admits lanes fairly,
 * so one deep or slow source cannot consume the whole page budget and make the
 * others invisible. Its continuations live only inside this invocation: there is
 * no checkpoint, resume custody, durable cursor or `deferred` arm, and an
 * interruption simply ends the pass so a later trigger starts at the first page
 * (`core/CORPUS.md` §4.3, `INV-03`).
 *
 * The pass concludes nothing about absence. A finished walk is health evidence,
 * never set-complement evidence, which is why it emits only the three bounded
 * scan-evidence names plus the two honest non-evidence arms.
 *
 * A page is qualified atomically. An admitted source contribution is trusted
 * code holding an admitted operation handle, so a page it returns that violates
 * the host-plugin contract — a local ref outside the published grammar, a kind
 * its own descriptor never declared, or more rows than the limit this pass
 * submitted — is a defect in that source rather than a bad provider row it was
 * supposed to filter. Tolerance for untrusted provider rows belongs inside the
 * source, which is why salvaging the valid siblings here would publish a
 * conforming-looking lane for a source that is not conforming: its walk
 * evidence would read healthy while its contract defect stayed invisible. The whole page is therefore rejected, the lane is
 * marked failed with the closed `unsupportedContract` class, and neither the
 * page's evidence nor any observation this lane produced in this pass is
 * adopted — so the consumer keeps its last-known-good rather than a silently
 * partial view of a broken source.
 *
 * A page that does not answer before an explicitly supplied whole-lane
 * deadline is not a contract violation. Reaching that real caller-owned bound
 * settles the lane as a classified `transient` failure and stops waiting for
 * the provider work. Without such a duration, the pass follows only the
 * canonical caller signal. It keeps every page the lane already gave, because
 * an unanswered page says nothing about the ones that answered. The pass
 * schedules no wake and retries nothing: a later view or manual trigger asks
 * again after the shared pacing backoff.
