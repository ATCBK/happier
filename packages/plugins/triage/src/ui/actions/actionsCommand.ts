 * directly drives `actions/actionsCatalog.ts` over its own Account KV
 * scope, so the configured actions stay readable and editable with no daemon
 * reachable — a configured action is Account state, not provider data. A mount
 * that cannot invokes the same two published Actions through a daemon. The module owns no state and makes no decision:
 * `settings/actions.ts` still mints the action id, validates every bound and
 * closed vocabulary, decides the conflict verdict and refuses a reorder that is
 * not an exact permutation. This is transport plus the one conversion a caller
 * must not spell twice — an Action projection read back as the owner's own read
