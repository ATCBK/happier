/**
 * The display clock for the coordinator's refusal and an optional visible read age.
 *
 * A pacing block is an absolute moment: the coordinator publishes
 * `nextEligibleAtMs`, and every surface that offers **Refresh** decides from it
 * whether a press may read right now. Reading `Date.now()` at render answers
 * that question correctly and answers it exactly once — so a page whose reader
 * simply waits out the deadline it was shown keeps a dead control and a notice
 * that has stopped being true. Nothing else was going to wake it: the window
 * store drops an expired refusal only when something reads its snapshot, and an
 * idle page reads nothing.
 *
 * One timeout observes the next displayed boundary: the published refusal's
 * expiry or the next minute of a visible read age. Pass completedAtMs only
 * while showing that age; hiding it removes its wake. The timestamp comes from
 * the list store, never window assembly or mount time. This reads no provider,
 * starts no pass and makes no freshness decision: the deadline, reason and eligibility rule all
 * remain the coordinator's (`core/CORPUS.md` §4.2), and all this does is ask
 * the same owner again at the one moment its answer can have changed.
 *
 * It is deliberately not in the window store. A store-level wake would notify
 * every subscriber of a fact none of them may be showing, and the store's
 * own contract is that an elapsed refusal expires on READ — which is the right
 * rule for a projection and the wrong one for a control a person is looking at.
