/**
 * Read this surface's mounted PRs & Issues window.
 *
 * Acquisition rides on the external-store subscription rather than on a render
 * or a separate effect, because React already owns that lifecycle: it
 * subscribes when the consumer commits and unsubscribes when it unmounts, so a
 * render that never commits cannot leak an acquisition and a StrictMode replay
 * cannot double-count one. It is also what makes a host scope change safe:
 * React resubscribes, releases this artifact's old shared-value lease, and
 * joins the new Account/plugin/generation scope without inheriting rows.
 *
 * Reading is not demanding. Mounting *the PRs & Issues page* is a named
 * materialization producer (`core/CORPUS.md` §4.1) and mounting the Composer
 * picker is not, so the demand belongs to the page rather than to this shared
 * hook: opening the picker must not turn a cold shared window into a full walk
 * of every configured source. A consumer that is a producer calls `refresh` from
 * its own mount effect; every demand it makes still passes through the one
 * shared minimum interval, so a cold or stale window starts exactly one pass no
 * matter how much of that surface asked.
 *
 * There is no timer and no poller here, and none anywhere beneath it.
