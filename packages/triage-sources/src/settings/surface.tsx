/**
 * The one PRs & Issues settings page, and the identity a source supplies to get it.
 *
 * This is the page a person actually uses to put a source into PRs & Issues. It
 * does exactly three things, and deliberately nothing else:
 *
 *  1. it asks THAT source for the accounts and scopes it can reach, through the
 *     source's own `listInstances` Action, and selectable units through its
 *     optional `listScopeUnits` Action;
 *  2. it asks the TARGET which of them that source has already configured,
 *     through the public `happier.triage/sources/read-configured-v1` Action;
 *  3. it asks the TARGET to create, update, remove or restore the one the user
 *     chose, through the single public `happier.triage/sources/administer-v1`
 *     Action.
 *
 * It never writes `source-instances`, never sees or renders a credential, never
 * enumerates host accounts, and holds no second record of what is configured.
 * The account a candidate binds arrives inside the draft the source produced
 * from its own purpose-bound Connected Account listing. The caller-scoped read
 * hands back the source's own opaque configuration token as part of the stored
 * record. The source editor receives that configuration with the current
 * discovered binding and locator, or the exact retained fields when the source
 * declares its instance-key stability; only the source's codec interprets its bytes.
 *
 * The administration Action's shared approval policy owns every lifecycle
 * change, including Remove. This page adds no question or consent bit of its
 * own, so an explicit Allowed preference is honored here too.
 *
 * Configuration is reversible, and it survives closing the page. The target's own
 * caller-scoped read is what a row's state comes from, so a source configured in
 * an earlier visit offers Update and Remove, and one removed in an earlier visit
 * offers Restore — which is the only arm that may revive a retired row and does
 * so under that row's exact stable ref. A press made here wins over that read
 * only when the target settled it successfully; a refused press teaches this page
 * nothing.
 *
 * A configured instance a source can no longer see is still listed and removable.
 * Sources that qualify a retained draft also keep configuration editing available.
 * Dropping it would leave a person with entries that
 * never arrive and no way to remove the source producing them.
 *
 * Every state it can be in is a distinct sentence. A listing that could not be
 * completed still renders its rows and says so; an exact account that failed is
 * named beside the accounts that worked; an outcome nobody knows is never
 * offered as a retry. A page that renders any of those as "nothing here" would
 * tell the user their account is gone.
 *
 * ## Why this page lives here and not in each source
 *
 * Every source's page reads the same three published contracts and reaches the
 * same conclusions from the same bytes. The only source-specific facts on it are
 * the three in `TriageSourceSettingsSurfaceIdentityV1`. Written per source it was
 * six byte-identical copies of the model and six copies of this component, of
 * which one carried a test — so a correction applied to five and forgotten in one
 * was invisible, and the remount fix above would have been written six times.
 * A source contributes its identity; the page is one.
